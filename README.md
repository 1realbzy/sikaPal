sikaPal - Personal Finance Assistant for Africa
üîµ Version 0.1.0 | üü¢ MIT License | üü£ Python | üü° Twi Support

A data-driven personal finance assistant for African markets

üìä Introduction

sikaPal (from the Akan word "sika" meaning money) is an intelligent, privacy-focused personal finance platform designed specifically for Africans and emerging market users. It enables financial literacy through smart expense tracking, behavioral insights, and goal-driven recommendations.

Unlike conventional finance apps, sikaPal is built with local cultural contexts in mind. It offers support for Ghanaian languages (starting with Twi) and focuses on the specific financial challenges and opportunities in African markets.

Note: This project is under active development. We‚Äôre shipping features fast and iterating based on user feedback.
